# Web Scraping Project with Pandas

This project involves web scraping a specific data table from Wikipedia using Python's Pandas library. The extracted data includes column titles and rows, which are exported as a CSV file in Excel format.

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to perform web scraping using Pandas and extracting specific data from a Wikipedia table. The extracted information is then processed and exported for further analysis or usage.

## Project Structure

The project structure includes the following main components:
- Jupyter Notebook for web scraping and data processing.
- CSV file exported from the scraped data.

## Project Workflow

1. **Web Scraping**: Using Pandas to scrape a specific table from Wikipedia.
2. **Data Processing**: Extracting column titles and rows from the scraped data.
3. **Exporting**: Saving the processed data as a CSV file in Excel format.

## Project Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook for detailed code and steps.
3. Execute the notebook cells to reproduce the web scraping process.
4. Access the exported CSV file for the scraped data.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas library
- Jupyter Notebook

## File Structure

- `web_scraping_project.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the web scraping code.
- `scraped_data.csv`: Exported CSV file with extracted data.
